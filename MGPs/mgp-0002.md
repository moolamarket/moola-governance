# Overview

Use the deployed `MOOConfigurator` contract to call the needed functions for setting up cREAL reserve.

# Proposed Changes

1. Deploy a new MoolaOracle contract for getting MOO tokens and future tokens from Ubeswap price feeds

2. Call `LendingPoolAddressesProvider.setPriceOracle()` to set the oracle to the new MoolaOracle

3. Set the `MOOConfigurator` contract to be the `POOL_ADMIN`

4. After the `MOOConfigurator.execute` function has been called, set `POOL_ADMIN` back to the OwnedWallet

## Revert transaction

1. Call LendingPoolConfigurator.freezeReserve to freeze the cREAl reserve if anything goes wrong

# Verification

1. Verify all the params in the `MOOConfigurator` contract is correct on the explorer page ()
2. Verify the encoded data is correct

# Risk

Low risk -- the `MOOConfigurator` contract is verified and anyone can view and confirm the source code. `execute` function does not require any params, all data is hardcoded.
